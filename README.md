# Webscraping Challenge - Module 11
This repository contains my code and analysis for Module 11's web scraping challenge. The completed code can be found in the folder titled `Mars_Scrape`, with two jupyter notebook files for parts 1 and 2 respectively titled `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` and `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`. The starter code files used as a basis for both of these files, titled `part_1_mars_news_starter.ipynb` and `part_2_mars_weather_starter.ipynb` can be found in the `Starter_Code` folder, held in the `Mars_Scrape` folder.

The csv file which is generated from the code is titled `mars_temp_data.csv`, and is located in the `Outputs` folder in the main repository.

To write the code, I primarily referenced the in-class activities from Module 11, which demonstrated how to use HTML tags to locate and extract specific elements from a webpage. In particular, Activity 06 from Day 2 and Activities 04 and 05 from Day 3 were especially helpful.

## Analysis

In my analysis of the Mars data, I found that the coolest month was month 3, with an average minimum temperature of -83.3°C, while the warmest month was month 8, with an average minimum temperature of -68.4°C.

The month with the lowest atmospheric pressure was month 6, averaging 745.1 pascals, and the month with the highest pressure was month 9, with an average of 913.3 pascals. Although the units of measurement were not explicitly provided, pascals are the most likely unit given that these values align with known pressure ranges on Mars.

Additionally, I discovered that a Martian year is approximately 700 Earth days. This conclusion is based on the observation that it took about 700 days for the minimum temperatures to complete one full oscillation from one annual low to the next, suggesting that this is the time Mars takes to complete its orbit around the Sun.
